# INSTALL

There is a ./configure script but it takes no arguments.
It just adjusts the Makefile to install into directories
that exist on the local system, and to include the installation
of a systemd service and timer on systems that have systemd,
or to include the installation of an anacron weekly cronjob
on other systems (if they have anacron).

The Makefile can instead (or subsequently) be adjusted manually.

The Makefile has several install/uninstall targets:

        The following make targets are available:

          help              - Show this information (default target)
          check             - Check the local system for prerequisites
          install           - Same as install-bin + install-cfg + install-man
          install-bin       - Install /usr/local/bin/danebot
          install-cfg       - Install /etc/default/danebot
          install-man       - Install /usr/local/share/man/man1/danebot.1
          install-systemd   - Install /lib/systemd/system/danebot.service, /lib/systemd/system/danebot.timer
          install-cronjob   - Install /etc/cron.weekly/danebot
          uninstall         - Same as uninstall-bin + uninstall-man
          uninstall-bin     - Uninstall /usr/local/bin/danebot
          uninstall-cfg     - Uninstall /etc/default/danebot
          uninstall-man     - Uninstall /usr/local/share/man/man1/danebot.1
          uninstall-systemd - Uninstall /lib/systemd/system/danebot.service, /lib/systemd/system/danebot.timer
          uninstall-cronjob - Uninstall /etc/cron.weekly/danebot
          systemd-enable    - Enable and start the systemd timer
          systemd-disable   - Disable the systemd timer
          purge             - Same as uninstall + uninstall-cfg
          man               - Create ./danebot.1
          clean             - Delete ./danebot.1
          ls                - Run ls -l for all installed files

        Before installing, read INSTALL for more details.
        After installing, read "man danebot" for more details.

To install danebot:

        ./configure
        make check
        make install

On systems with systemd, you will also need to enable and start the danebot
timer. To do this, first stop and disable the certbot timer, if necessary:

        systemctl stop certbot.timer
        systemctl disable certbot.timer

Then enable and start the danebot timer:

        make systemd-enable
        # or
        systemctl enable danebot.time
        systemctl start danebot.timer

On systems without systemd, but with anacron, "make install" will install
a weekly cronjob that is automatically enabled.

On systems with neither, you have to install a weekly-ish cronjob manually.
It should look something like this:

        0 0 * * 0 danebot renew

Danebot can be uninstalled with:

        make uninstall

This will automatically stop and disable the systemd timer, if necessary, or
remove the anacron weekly cronjob, if necessary, but it won't remove a
manually added cronjob. You would need to remove it manually as well.

It also won't uninstall the /etc/default/danebot (or similar) configuration
file, which you might have modified. To do that as well:

        make purge

If you had to manually add a cronjob, you'll have to remove it manually as
well.

# REQUIREMENTS

Danebot requires the following programs:

        bash, certbot, perl, openssl, rsync, readlink, dirname, basename,
        find, mktemp, diff, xxd or hexdump

In addition, installing danebot requires:

        make, pod2man

Some of these are standard. Others will need to be installed via
the local system's package management system if they are not already
present.

Danebot also requires the following perl modules:

        Net::DNS::Resolver
        Net::DNS::Packet
        Net::DNS::Header
        Net::DNS::RR
        Net::DNS::RR::TLSA

These can all be installed with:

        cpan Net::DNS

But your local system might have a package for this instead
(e.g., libnet-dns-perl on Debian).
